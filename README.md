## Setup
For security reasons I use a file called [AppSettings.cs.dist](/src/ChatBot.Server/AppSettings.cs.dist) you must change their name to **AppSettings.cs** and complete with your credentials obtained in your azure account:

### Server project

```cs
public static class AppSettings
{
    public static readonly string TranslatorUriBase = "https://api.microsofttranslator.com/V2/Http.svc/";
    public static readonly string TranslatorKey = "";
    public static readonly string DefaultLanguage = "en";
    public static readonly string UserLanguageKey = "LanguageCode";
    public static readonly string OcpApimSubscriptionKeyHeader = "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key";
}
```

### Client project 
[AppSettings.cs.dist](/src/ChatBot.Clients/ChatBot.Clients/AppSettings.cs.dist)

```cs
public static class AppSettings
{
    public static readonly string DirectLineKey = "";
    public static readonly string BaseBotEndPointAddress = "https://directline.botframework.com/v3/directline/conversations/";
}
```
